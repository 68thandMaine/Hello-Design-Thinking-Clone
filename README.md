## Description

This project is an exercise using Angular 5 to recreate/clone a website that was listed on the [Made with Angular Website](https://www.madewithangular.com/#/).

## Installation instructions

To use this app, first clone the repositiory from [GitHub](https://github.com/68thandMaine/Galatic-Age-Calculator.git). Once the app has been appropriately cloned the app can be accessed by using the following commands in the terminal:
1. `$npm install`
  - This command will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
2. In the current state (as of 1/25/19), this project will only be running in a development enviornment. See the section below on how to set up the devlopment

### Development server
